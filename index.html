            <ul>
              <li>I led two discussion sections, graded quizzes, and proctored exams for a first course in calculus. I created my own worksheets, solutions, and exam study guides. All content from my sections can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hMayaIC0e5POcbUU7wh22sZG8UUGvth6?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.

            <ul>
              <li> I remotely created discussion resources in preparation for the first online iteration of Math 1A in the summer of 2024. As the asynchronous GSI, my worksheets, solutions, and video walkthroughs are available for students to use on their own time. </li>
              <li> My worksheet book can be found <a href="documents/workbook.pdf">here</a> and my solutions book can be found <a href="documents/workbook-solutions.pdf">here</a>.</li>

            <h2>Summer 2024: Instructor for CodebreakHERs</h2>
            <ul>
              <li> I volunteered at a summer camp at the University of South Florida for middle and high school aged girls interested in cybersecurity. I led an introductory lesson on coding theory, from the definition of a code to the motivation behind error correction.</li>
              <li> You can find a lesson plan <a href="documents/coding-theory-lesson-plan.pdf">here</a> and accompanying slides <a href="documents/coding-theory-slides.pdf">here</a>. An interactive guess-who game to demonstrate error detection and correction in a [5, 2] linear code can be found <a href="codebreakhers/guess-who/">here</a>. </li>
